<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<hr />
<p>Established in 2016, Cyclistic is a bike-share offering service
located in Chicago, USA. Cyclistic currently offers more than 5,800
bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of over 690
stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to another station in the system anytime.</p>
<p>As of August 2021, Cyclistic offers the following plans:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single ride passes<br />
</li>
<li>Full day passes<br />
</li>
<li>Annual memberships</li>
</ul>
<p>The Cyclistic team have recently concluded that annual memberships
are more profitable than casual riders. Furthermore, the team have noted
that while 30% of users use the bikes for their work commute, the
majority of Cyclistic users ride for leisure. This report will assess
how existing Cyclistic causal riders can be encouraged to convert to
annual memberships.</p>
<p><br />

<div id="process" class="section level2">
<h2>2. Process</h2>
<hr />
<p>Cyclistic has provided historical data to be analyzed. For the
purpose of this analysis, the only data between August 2021 and July
20222 has been considered. The data was further processed to remove rows
where the trip time was negative (potentially false starts or users
trying to re-dock a bike to ensure it was secure). The license to use
this dataset can be located <a
href="https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement">here</a>.</p>
<p>There are around 700,000-800,000 entries for each month saved under
their own CSV. Due to the size of the dataset, R has been used to clean
and process the large datasets. The chances of any human or manual error
are quite low as the data has directly been taken from the bikes
themselves. Due to the data privaacy rules, there is no data relating to
the type of user.</p>
<p>The data has been cleaned after merging all the 12 datasets into one,
deleting incomplete data elements, removing inconsistencies in data,
removing negative ride lengths, sorting the dataset by start time. The
complete documentation has been provided in the “Data Cleaning
Process”.</p>
<p>The data cleaning process highlighted that there are a few stations
which are added or deleted in the Cyclistic Portfolio during the
analysis time frame.</p>
<p>The cleaned dataset has been saved under the file name
“trips_cleaned.</p>

<div id="analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>3. Analysis</h2>
<hr />
<p><strong>3.1 Most Popular Stations</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img
src="C:/Users/jains/Downloads/Cyclistic%20Project/Visualizations/Top_Stations_Casual.png" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This chart demonstrates the top 30 stations which were used during
the timeframe of the analysis for Casual Riders. It shows us that
<em>Streeter Dr &amp; Grand Ave</em> is the most popular station with
total 11,112 round trips. This also shows that most of the casual riders
have same start and end stations, hence they tend to keep the bike with
them for a longer time which leads to increased trip time.</p>
<p>We could also visualize the following data using latitude and
longitude points on the map. Using this will show if the popular
stations are lying in a particular region or different.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img
src="C:/Users/jains/Downloads/Cyclistic%20Project/Visualizations/Top_Stations_Members.png" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This chart demonstrates the top 30 stations which were used during
the timeframe of the analysis for subscribers. It shows that <em>Ellis
Ave &amp; 60th St-Ellis Ave &amp; 55th St</em> is the most popular
stations with 5667 total round trips. So the station used by casual
riders was the most popular station. Further, there were very few
instances where start and end stations were same.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Most Popular Time Of Year</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img
src="C:/Users/jains/Downloads/Cyclistic%20Project/Visualizations/Day_of_week.png" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This Shows us that weekends are the most popular time of the week.
This confirms that most of the rides are for leisure purposes. With
further statistical analysis we found that Saturday has the most no. of
rides with total rides adding to 778,179 rides. However, the total rides
differ based on the membership.<br />
Casual riders tend to have more rides on weekends while members have
more rides during weekdays. The data shows that Saturday is the most
busy day for Casual riders having total rides of 422,687 rides while
Tuesday is the most busy day for members having total rides of 419,968
rides.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img
src="C:/Users/jains/Downloads/Cyclistic%20Project/Visualizations/Time_Of_Year.png" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If we further analyze the trends breaking down the data for every
month, we could see that summers months are the most popular time of
year for Cyclistic. After further exploration, we found that 14th July
2021 was the Cyclistic’s most popular date with 32,693 trips occuring in
one day.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This shows that members use the Cyclistic service more consistently
throughout the year having maximum rides on weekdays unlike casual
riders whose maximum rides on weekends. Hence, it can be concluded that
members use Cyclistic Bikes mostly for commute to work whereas casual
riders use bike service for leisure purposes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>3.3 Most Popular Time Of Day</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img
src="C:/Users/jains/Downloads/Cyclistic%20Project/Visualizations/Time_of_day.png" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The above line chart shows that the time around 5PM is the most
popular time of the day for Cyclistic users. The most common time for
members being 17:18:23 for members and 17:20:12 for casual riders. The
significant increase of member riders using the bike at 8AM and 5PM
suggests that a lot of members are using the Cyclistic service for their
work commutes.</p>
<p>Further the average ride length for casual riders is 26.61 mins while
members ride for an average of 12.6 mins. This again shows that casual
riders use Cyclistic bike for leisure purposes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>3.4 Longest Ride Length</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img
src="C:/Users/jains/Downloads/Cyclistic%20Project/Visualizations/Greater_than_1.png" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The following scatter plot shows us that in case of casual riders
there are many rides where trip time is greater than 1 day whereas for
members there were very few instances where rides were greater than 1
day. The maximum days for which a bike was used continuously was 28
Days. We should consider the pricing options available for this
case.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
</div>
<div id="recomendations" class="section level2">
<h2>4. Recomendations</h2>
<hr />
<p>As identified in the client brief, the marketing recommendations
concluded from the insights of this case study should not be focused on
encouraging new customers to use the Cyclistic bike service but instead
focus on encouraging casual riders to convert to annual memberships.</p>
<p>The possible marketing recommendations based on the data available
could be:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong><em>1. Digital Campaign showing Cyclistic’s Bikes being used
in Chicago local’s everyday life.</em></strong></p>
<p>Section 3.3 identified that the most common time of day for casual
and member riders was 5pm. Although casual riders use the bikes slightly
more than members during the evening and early hours of the morning, the
most popular time of day for casual riders is similar to member riders
which is still during the day with a slight peak during work commute
times. This insight highlights that there are casual riders using the
Cyclistic service for their work commute without investing in an annual
membership. To encourage casual riders to become members, a digital
campaign which encourages Chicago locals to observe how Cyclistic fits
into their every day life would be beneficial. This would also help
change public opinion that Cyclistic is a predominantly tourist
service.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong><em>2. Notifications/ Email reminders to casual riders to
observe price benefits of annual memberships</em></strong></p>
<p>As we have seen from analysis, casual riders tend to have more longer
trips. Notifications can be sent to observe price benefits of annual
memberships for longer trips rather than purchasing regualar casual
trips.</p>
<p><br />
